Homework 5
----------

There is only one problem and it is worth 10 points. 

Problem 1:
----------

Implement a simple database in Erlang that support the functions:

- start
- stop
- insert
- retrieve

To do this, you have to complete the code in the body of the
loop function.  You must not change any other code!!!

insert(Key, Value) associates the value Value with the key Key.
  It should return the atom done.

retrieve(Key) retrieves the value associated with the Key key.  If
  no value is associated with the key Key, then the atom undefined
  should be returned.

stop() unregisters db and ensures that the process terminates.  The atom 
  stopped should be returned.

You can test your implementation by running db_tests:start().
