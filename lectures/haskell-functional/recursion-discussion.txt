* notes for helping learn recursion

** What lists are
	Q: How would you define lists?
	show the data definition from this:
		data [t] = [] | t : []

** Data-driven recursion and working from examples
	emphasize how working examples helps you find what to do
		for the recursive case

	Show how to do add1each

	examples:
		add1each [] = []
		add1each [1,3,5] = [2,4,6]
		add1each [3,5]   =   [4,6]

	how do we get [2,4,6] from 1 and [4,6]?
	now generalize

> add1each [] = []
> add1each (x:xs) = (1+x):(add1each xs)

	Try the following problems:
		delete_first
		subst
		append
		reverse
		lookup in association lists
